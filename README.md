Hi, my name is Chris ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a 2nd year PhD student with the complex systems and statistical physics group at the University of Manchester.  

Our interests focus on the application of techniques from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics to study complex systems: a system composed of many components 
that may interact with each other, examples include agents in a financial market, organisms in an ecosystem or diseases in a population, to name a few.

My current research is in the field of linguistic typology where I model the evolution of language features to learn more about languages. Most of the work involves 
building mathematical models that replicate the real-world dynamics of languages evolving and interacting with each other. I then build simulations, using Python 
and C++, to test these models against analytical solutions and real world empirical data.
