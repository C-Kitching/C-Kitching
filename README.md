Hi, my name is Chris ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a 3rd year PhD student with the complex systems and statistical physics group at the University of Manchester.  

Our interests focus on the application of techniques from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics to study complex systems: a system composed of many components 
that may interact with each other. Currently I am working on agent based models in linguistics and evolutionary game theory
